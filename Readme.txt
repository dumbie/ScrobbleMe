ScrobbleMe is an easy to use modern Windows Last.fm song scrobbler,
the app scrobbles your recently played songs to Last.fm with just one tap,
you can also synchronize your loved songs with your Last.fm profile and view
your recommended artists, top artists, recently scrobbled and loved songs.

ScrobbleMe currently does not support the default Windows 10 Groove Music
player because Groove Music no longer keeps track of how many times a song
has been played so ScrobbleMe also doesn't know what to scrobble to Last.fm.

| Installation Instructions
1) Install the ScrobbleMe application on your Windows Phone from the store.
2) Set your Last.fm account name and password in the "Settings" tab and login.
3) Scrobble your songs to Last.fm profile by clicking on "Scrobble songs"

| Update Instructions
Please scrobble all your songs before updating to a newer ScrobbleMe version,
when the songs have been reset you can skip all the songs in the "Settings" tab,
After a succesfull ScrobbleMe update please relogin to your Last.fm account.
